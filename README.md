As a dedicated front-end developer, I am thrilled to share my recent project, an ecommerce site that I have been working on for the past 30 days. This project showcases my expertise in utilizing a powerful tech stack, including Next.js, React Redux, Tailwind CSS, Firebase Auth, and Strapi CMS. Throughout the development process, my primary focus was to create a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience. Now, let me dive into the impressive features that I have implemented in this ecommerce project.

## Technologies Used
<details>
  <summary> <h3> Next js 13 (beta)</h3> </summary>
  I utilized the cutting-edge features of Next.js 13's beta app, harnessing its powerful capabilities to enhance the ecommerce project.

  Routing was made effortless with the file-system based router built on top of Server Components. This allowed me to easily implement layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more, ensuring smooth and intuitive navigation throughout the site.

  To achieve optimal rendering performance, I leveraged the benefits of both client-side and server-side rendering with Client and Server Components. I took advantage of Next.js' Static and Dynamic Rendering options on the server, optimizing the streaming process for both the Edge and Node.js runtimes. This ensured efficient content delivery and enhanced the overall user experience.

  Simplified data fetching was made possible through the async/await support in React Components and the fetch()s API. This aligned perfectly with React and the Web Platform, allowing me to effortlessly retrieve data and seamlessly integrate it into the application.

  For styling, Next.js 13 provided excellent support for various styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS. This flexibility enabled me to choose the preferred styling approach for the project, ensuring consistent and visually appealing designs.

  To further enhance the performance and user experience, I implemented image, font, and script optimizations. These optimizations targeted Core Web Vitals, resulting in improved loading times and a smoother overall experience for users.

  Additionally, Next.js 13 offered improved support for TypeScript, featuring better type checking and more efficient compilation. I took advantage of the custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker, which streamlined the development process and enhanced the codebase's maintainability.

  <summary> <h3> React redux </h3> </summary>
  I utilized React Redux for efficient global state management throughout my ecommerce project. By leveraging React Redux, I ensured seamless communication and synchronization of states across various components in the application. One key area where React Redux played a crucial role was in managing the shopping cart functionality. With the help of Redux's centralized store, I could easily add, remove, and update items in the cart, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience. Additionally, I utilized React Redux to handle the state of filters applied across different panels in the application. This allowed users to refine their product search by applying various filters such as price range, category, or brand, ensuring a personalized and tailored shopping experience. Furthermore, React Redux empowered me to manage the state of toggleable side menus, enabling users to conveniently navigate through different sections of the app. By effectively utilizing React Redux for global state management, I streamlined the user interface and ensured that data was consistently and accurately shared across relevant components.

<details>
  <summary> <h3> Tailwind CSS </h3> </summary>
  Tailwind CSS proved to be an invaluable tool in making my ecommerce site fully responsive. With its utility-first approach, Tailwind CSS made the process of creating a responsive design effortless and efficient. By leveraging its extensive set of pre-defined classes, I was able to apply responsive styles to different elements with ease. Whether it was adjusting the layout, font sizes, or spacing, Tailwind CSS provided me with the flexibility to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience across various devices and screen sizes. The simplicity and scalability of Tailwind CSS significantly streamlined the responsive design process, allowing me to focus on delivering a seamless browsing experience for users on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.

<details>
  <summary> <h3> Firebase Auth </h3> </summary>
  For user authentication, I leveraged the power of Firebase Auth in my ecommerce project, ensuring a seamless sign-up and login experience for users. By integrating Firebase Auth, I was able to provide a secure and efficient authentication process. Users can easily create new accounts, log in with their credentials, and enjoy a personalized shopping experience tailored to their preferences. Firebase Auth handles the authentication flow, including email verification and password reset functionality, allowing users to engage with the platform effortlessly. This seamless integration of Firebase Auth showcases my ability to implement robust authentication systems and prioritize user security in my front-end development projects.

<details>
  <summary> <h3> Strapi CMS, database, Next js route handlers </h3> </summary>
  I utilized Strapi CMS as the backend solution for my ecommerce project, enabling seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. To ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, I integrated SQLite as the database for the project.

For secure API communication between the front end and the backend, I implemented a bearer token authentication mechanism. This approach provides an additional layer of security by requiring a valid token for accessing protected routes and performing authorized actions.

To handle the routing and server-side rendering (SSR) aspects of the application, I leveraged the powerful Next.js framework. Next.js route handlers allowed me to define custom API endpoints, which efficiently handled specific requests and seamlessly connected with the Strapi CMS backend.

By combining Strapi CMS, SQLite, bearer token authentication, and Next.js route handlers, I was able to create a robust and scalable backend infrastructure that supported smooth CRUD operations while ensuring data security and efficient API communication.

This comprehensive backend setup demonstrates my ability to integrate different technologies and frameworks, showcasing my skills in building end-to-end solutions that provide a seamless user experience while ensuring data integrity and security.

  <summary> <h3> Vercel and Render Hosting </h3> </summary>
 
I utilized Vercel to host the front-end portion of my ecommerce site, ensuring a reliable and scalable hosting solution. Vercel's platform allowed me to deploy and serve my Next.js application with ease, providing high-performance delivery and automatic scaling capabilities.

For the back-end part of the site, I chose Render as the hosting platform. Render offered a robust and flexible environment for deploying my Strapi CMS-powered backend. With Render, I could effortlessly manage the backend infrastructure, ensuring smooth operations, and efficient scaling as needed.

By leveraging Vercel and Render, I created a seamless integration between the front-end and back-end components of my ecommerce site. This combination of hosting platforms provided a reliable and scalable infrastructure, allowing me to deliver an optimal user experience while efficiently managing the deployment and hosting processes.p demonstrates my ability to integrate different technologies and frameworks, showcasing my skills in building end-to-end solutions that provide a seamless user experience while ensuring data integrity and security.
